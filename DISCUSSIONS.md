## Performance & Optimization

**Q: Large repository performance**
Has anyone experienced slowdowns when generating stats for repositories with 10k+ commits? Looking for optimization strategies and best practices for handling large datasets.

**Q: API rate limiting**
What's the best approach to handle GitHub API rate limits when processing multiple repositories? Currently hitting limits with organization-wide stats generation.

## Feature Requests

**Idea: Dark mode support**
Would love to see a dark mode option for the generated statistics visualizations. Many developers prefer dark themes and it would improve accessibility.

**Q: CI/CD integration**
Anyone successfully integrated this into their GitHub Actions workflow? Looking for examples of automated stats generation on schedule.

**Q: Private repository support**
What's the recommended setup for generating stats from private repositories? Need guidance on token permissions and security considerations.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Empty stats generation**
Getting empty results despite having commits. Checked email configuration and it matches GitHub settings. Any other common causes?

**Q: Memory usage optimization**
Processing large organizations causes high memory usage. Any recommendations for optimizing memory consumption during stats generation?
